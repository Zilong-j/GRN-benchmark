# GRN-benchmark
This project includes four inference methods for inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell multi-omics data. The scMEGA and Pando methods are based on R language, and LINGER and Dictys are based on Python.

The four methods are specified in the table below
| Methods | Language | Class |Reference Link |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|   scMEGA  |   R |   Correlation |  https://github.com/CostaLab/scMEGA |
|   Pando |   R |   Regression | https://github.com/quadbio/Pando |
|   LINGER  |  Python |   Deep learning | https://github.com/Durenlab/LINGER |
|   Dictys |   Python |   Dynamical systems | https://github.com/pinellolab/dictys |


We replicated the process of inferring GRNs using these four methods on the PBMC 10K and 3K datasets.\
Before running the code you need to first configure the environment it requires.
